After Class Comments:

I noticed a lot of you are having trouble placing images in Wordpress. Use this snippet to place an image from your images folder:  
```
<img src="<?= get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/yourimagesfolder/imagename.jpg">
```

Also, for background images, many of you are using full width background images, so make sure you review your [CSS background image placement rules](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp).

Namely a lot of you are using large background images, so look at ```background-size``` and ```background-position``` rules.

Also, please ask questions if you have them. You don't have to lose hours up on hours on something you could have gotten answered by asking a question.
